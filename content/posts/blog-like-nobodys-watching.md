i've made a dumb website for my custom domain. hooray.  

i registered the domain for e-mail but it might as well have a site on it too. i thought it would be cute to curate a list of video games i'd like to play, which will mostly be strategy and board games that are too cumbersome and will never happen.  

maybe i'll blog about the games i'm playing sometimes? or other things? unlikely.

anyway i also want to test a video embed so here's me being startled by a mongoose in halo
