I've made a dumb website for my custom domain. Hooray.  

I registered the domain for e-mail but it might as well have a site on it too. The only thing I could think of to put on it was video games of course. I'm going to curate a list of games I'd like to play, which will mostly be strategy and board games that will never happen.  

Maybe I'll blog about games sometimes?  

Maybe I'll blog about other things? Even more unlikely.
