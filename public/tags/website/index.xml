      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a dumb website for my custom domain. Hooray.
I registered the domain for e-mail but it might as well have a site on it too. The only thing I could think of to put on it was video games of course. I&amp;rsquo;m going to curate a list of games I&amp;rsquo;d like to play, which will mostly be strategy and board games that will never happen.
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll blog about games sometimes?</description>
